28725,Skybuilders' Plywood,Sturdy enough to support the weight of several large Roegadyn. Until it isn't.,22508,20
28726,Skybuilders' Alloy,"At this stage, it is anyone's guess what this alloy will become. If it is extremely lucky, it may even end up as a door knocker.",20804,20
28727,Skybuilders' Steel Plate,"Unless a skilled blacksmith or armorer can intervene, this steel is doomed to spend eternity as a useless metal square.",20954,20
28728,Skybuilders' Ingot,"Even the skybuilders themselves are not quite sure what goes into these ingots, although the general consensus is that it is nothing valuable.",20814,20
28729,Skybuilders' Leather,"Leather made <Emphasis>for</Emphasis> skybuilders, not <Emphasis>from</Emphasis> them. Apparently.",23152,20
28730,Skybuilders' Rope,"How long is a length of rope? In this particular rope's case, this long.",26103,20
28731,Skybuilders' Ink,"Used for writing in ledgers to keep track of who is owed what. Considering the scale of the Ishgardian restoration, it is expected that a fair few bottles will be exhausted before the work is completed.",25920,20
28732,Skybuilders' Hemp Milk,"By all accounts, this plant-based milk has a pleasant enough taste, though Ishgardian culinarians have yet to succeed in efforts to turn it into cheese.",24406,20
28733,Skybuilders' Wain,"Surprisingly maneuverable, even when loaded with bricks and such.",52109,40
28734,Skybuilders' Nails,"Thankfully, this is a handful of <Emphasis>metal</Emphasis> nails, not ones grown from the fingers of the skybuilders themselves. That would be far less pleasant.",21004,40
28735,Skybuilders' Rivets,Those with a penchant for having little bits of metal sticking out from every surface in sight will be delighted to receive these carefully crafted metal studs.,21014,40
28736,Skybuilders' Rings,"An object without a clear purpose but will “probably come in handy one day,” as hoarders of useless junk are wont to say.",20911,40
28737,Skybuilders' Leather Straps,"Can be attached to the handles of tools to allow them to be hung from belts and so forth, though care should be taken while walking to avoid having them flailing around wildly.",22030,40
28738,Skybuilders' Cloth,"It seems this cloth is destined to become part of a comfortable couch, or perhaps a nice set of drapes.",21611,40
28739,Skybuilders' Plant Oil,"Used in the preparation of several varieties of Ishgardian cooking and, on some occasions, as a condiment.",22636,40
28740,Skybuilders' Uncooked Pasta,Uncooked pasta that is perfect for eating during construction. If you like uncooked pasta.,25058,40
28741,Skybuilders' Barrel,"The expression “a barrel of laughs” was never meant to be taken literally, though if it were, one could fit a fair few in this voluminous wooden container.",26547,150
28742,Skybuilders' Hammer,"In days to come, this most versatile of tools will become the bane of every nail that dared to stick out. And the occasional thumb.",35109,150
28743,Skybuilders' Cooking Pot,"In times of war, this metallic item of cookware can double as a makeshift helmet, provided the wearer has an unnaturally large head.",35701,150
28744,Skybuilders' Candelabra,"It almost seems a shame to cover this in layers of melted wax, though sadder still would be a candelabra without a candle.",53020,150
28745,Skybuilders' Rug,"The eventual owner of this majestic piece of thick cloth will be as snug as a bug in a rug. Or on a rug, to be precise.",52024,150
28746,Skybuilders' Broom,"As the saying goes, “A new broom sweeps clean,” though the person wielding said broom is also due at least some of the credit for any increase in cleanliness that may result.",26594,150
28747,Skybuilders' Charcoal,The recipients of the other items in your inventory would probably prefer that you refrained from carrying loose pieces of charcoal about your person.,26589,150
28748,Skybuilders' Tea,"As is tradition with tea brewed for builders, it contains enough sugar to make the spoon stand on end.",24408,150
28749,Skybuilders' Pedestal,"Though one should avoid putting other people on a pedestal, the placement of inanimate objects should not pose any problems.",52516,290
28750,Skybuilders' Crosscut Saw,It is not only double-edged blades that cut both ways.,26590,290
28751,Skybuilders' Counter,"Considering that it lacks the ability to count anything whatsoever, “counter” seems to be something of a misnomer.",51662,290
28752,Skybuilders' Stone,"If the time you have spent in Ishgard has taught you anything, it is that the locals <Emphasis>really</Emphasis> like stone.",21251,290
28753,Skybuilders' Longboots,"Ideal for leaping from scaffold to scaffold as one merrily frolics about the construction site, while others go about their backbreaking labor.",46139,290
28754,Skybuilders' Gloves,"Any Ishgardian with any sense will already own a pair of gloves, but for those who do not, these will be a welcome gift.",44036,290
28755,Skybuilders' Soap,Be careful to whom you give this. They may think you are trying to tell them something.,26591,290
28756,Skybuilders' All-purpose Infusion,"Though the recipe states that this mysterious concoction can cure any ailment, one must remember that it will under no circumstances reattach dismembered fingers, which is a remarkably common complaint among the skybuilders.",24413,290
28757,Skybuilders' Bed,Children who fail to heed the word of their parents will be sent here without any supper.,52462,430
28758,Skybuilders' Oven,"In many Ishgardian residences, the oven doubles as a means of heating the house, with the occupants finding themselves subconsciously drawn to the kitchen during the colder months. Which is all of them.",26593,430
28759,Skybuilders' Lamppost,"Of all the items you have managed to stow about your person, this surely ranks as one of the largest and most cumbersome. Even the most proficient of aetherochemists would be baffled by the unsolved mystery of your impossibly deep pockets.",52131,430
28760,Skybuilders' Brazier,"Not only can this be used for the cooking of various dishes, it also works wonders in the prevention of frostbite, as many residents of the Brume will attest.",52136,430
28761,Skybuilders' Overalls,"Designed to be worn on top of other layers of clothing to protect them from dust and dirt and provide additional protection against the cold. Since Ishgardians tend to wear several layers of clothing to begin with, these overalls are cut much larger than those worn in warmer climes.",42081,430
28762,Skybuilders' Waterproof Sheet,"Serves to keep out not only water, but wind as well, though the cold inevitably finds a way through eventually.",21615,430
28763,Skybuilders' Alchemic,"One of many concoctions that serves little purpose on its own, but can be mixed with others for a variety of effects upon consumption, the large majority being some sort of agonizing death.",20601,430
28764,Skybuilders' Stew,One unfortunate rail was left to stew in its own juices after finding its way into the pot. Literally.,53256,430
28765,Skybuilders' Yew Log,"The distinct lack of trees is one of many problems the first people to settle in Ishgard chose to ignore, making this otherwise commonplace material─sourced from the East Shroud─extremely valuable.",22409,20
28766,Skybuilders' Iron Ore,"While this may look much like any other iron ore found in middle La Noscea, there are subtle differences that only an expert in the field will recognize. The name, for one, is considerably longer.",21202,20
28767,Skybuilders' Fine Sand,"This sand gathered in central Thanalan is not only fine, but extremely well behaved, choosing to stay in one closely knit lump while jostling alongside the rest of your possessions.",21464,20
28768,Skybuilders' Hemp,"Though this hardy plant can grow almost anywhere, the snow-blasted precipices of Ishgard have so far proven too steep a challenge for it to overcome. This particular specimen was harvested in lower La Noscea, an environment far more conducive to plant life─or any sort of life, for that matter.",21654,20
28769,Skybuilders' Ash Log,Ash! A-Ah! Savior of the Firmament!♪,22407,40
28770,Skybuilders' Rock Salt,"Although upper La Noscea seems rather a distant location from which to source something as simple as salt, the Ishgardians are nothing if not particular in their tastes.",22617,40
28771,Skybuilders' Electrum Ore,"The electrum ore found in upper La Noscea is believed to be far better suited to the skybuilders' needs than any other variety. Were anyone to ask them why, they would, in most cases be met with a response along the line of, “Because it just is.”",21217,40
28772,Skybuilders' Iron Sand,"The tradition of measuring powdered substances in units of “pinches” has been the cause of many arguments, largely due to differences in finger size between the various races. Folk in eastern Thanalan, where this sample was gathered, have been known to ask Lalafells to measure when selling, and Roegadyn when buying, for obvious reasons.",21204,40
28773,Skybuilders' Flax,"It is a well known fact among botanists that the flax in the South Shroud is superior to every other kind, for reasons far too complicated and boring for anyone else to care about.",21651,40
28774,Skybuilders' Spring Water,"Having only traveled the relatively short distance from the Coerthas central highlands to Ishgard, this spring water is still remarkably fresh, though the icy chill threatens to freeze it inside the bottle.",22614,40
28775,Skybuilders' Camphorwood Log,"Few members of the mortal races are equipped to make the perilous journey to the Churning Mists, and those who do normally hope to have more than a log or two to show for their troubles.",22405,150
28776,Skybuilders' Straw,Why the skybuilders would specify that their straw be brought from the Dravanian forelands is anyone's guess. Perhaps the smell helps their chocobos sleep more peacefully?,21653,150
28777,Skybuilders' Hardsilver Ore,The time spent mining this ore in the Dravanian hinterlands would perhaps have seemed less arduous if you had the faintest idea how the skybuilders plan to use it.,21223,150
28778,Skybuilders' Mythrite Sand,"You have a sneaking suspicion that you may have lost some of the sand during the return journey from the Sea of Clouds, though the amount you have in your possession should still suffice.",21218,150
28779,Skybuilders' Tea Leaves,The thought of happy skybuilders drinking delicious tea was the only motivation you needed as you risked life and limb gathering these leaves in the Sea of Clouds.,25020,150
28780,Skybuilders' Dravanian Spring Water,"There are easier places to collect spring water than the Dravanian forelands, though it seems your personal safety is not especially high on the skybuilders' list of concerns.",22614,150
28781,Skybuilders' Urunday Log,"Compared to most places in Gyr Abania, the Peaks has more than its fair share of trees, so who would object to you taking a few logs? Bloodthirsty Qiqirn and rampaging ruud suuds, that's who. Or perhaps they just see you as an easy meal?",22420,290
28782,Skybuilders' Nightsteel Ore,"The Ruby Sea is not especially well known as a prime location for mining, though those who are nautically minded can uncover all sorts of rare and unique treasures. Whether the skybuilders choose to turn this into fine jewelry or something more mundane, like a tea strainer, remains to be seen.",21203,290
28783,Skybuilders' Adder,"Venomous snakes are something of a rarity in Ishgard, so the skybuilders have ordered that some be delivered from the Azim Steppe to help improve morale. Workers displaying a lack of enthusiasm will be given some time in “the pit” to rediscover their commitment to the cause.",22620,290
28784,Skybuilders' Molybdenum Ore,"While the Lochs are better known as a source of salt, the rich veins of ore are drawing in miners from far and wide.",21227,290
28785,Skybuilders' Horsetail,"Yanxia is rich in both flora and fauna, and horsetail forms a major part of the diet of many grazing creatures.",26592,290
28786,Skybuilders' Ala Mhigan Rock Salt,"When an Ishgardian culinarian stated that her latest dish needed a pinch of salt, the skybuilders sought out the very best, though perhaps more than a single pinch would be required to make the lengthy journey to the Lochs worthwhile.",22617,290
28787,Skybuilders' Ruby Sea Water,"While water from the Ruby Sea may not sound particularly appealing, this was actually brought from a small freshwater spring on one of the surrounding islands. Drinking this is unlikely to result in life-threatening dehydration.",22678,290
28788,Skybuilders' Durium Sand,"A pinch of anything tends not to be an awful lot, though this particular sand from the Azim Steppe is apparently worth more than its weight in gold.",21218,290
28789,Skybuilders' Vine,Quite why a particular type of vine that can only be found in the Azim Steppe is necessary to the skybuilders' plans has yet to be explained. Perhaps they are planning to surprise you with a work of surpassing genius? Or perhaps not.,21672,290
28790,Skybuilders' White Ash Log,"Obviously, none of the skybuilders has even heard of the Rak'tika Greatwood, though the specific qualities they seek in their timber can most easily be found in the white ash trees that grow there.",22406,430
28791,Skybuilders' Reef Rock,"If a porous rock from the bottom of the ocean is required in the rebuilding of Ishgard, then so be it. Your job is to mine, not question the reasoning behind such dubious demands.",21203,430
28792,Skybuilders' Truegold Ore,Why submit a boring chunk of gold ore when you can bring one all the way from Il Mheg instead?,21212,430
28793,Skybuilders' Cotton Boll,This cotton must be very special indeed for you to bring it all the way from Lakeland in the First. You can only hope that the skybuilders appreciate you going the extra malm. And traveling to another world.,25032,430
28794,Skybuilders' Dawn Lizard,"One day, this poor lizard is chasing other, smaller scurrying creatures across the desert plains of Amh Araeng, and the next, it is being transported to another world and dragged lashing and kicking to Ishgard. The chances of the cold-blooded scalekin being content in its frozen new surroundings are slim at best, and you can only hope that the skybuilders are grateful to you for supplying a miserable and motionless lizard.",22684,430
28795,Skybuilders' Wheat,"Were the other contributors to hear that you traveled to Amh Araeng in the First simply to procure wheat, they would think you are just trying to show off.",21653,430
28796,Skybuilders' Truegold Sand,The isle of Kholusia is known by the inhabitants of Norvrandt to have the very finest of gold sand. Whether this is up to the impossibly high standards of the skybuilders will only become apparent when it is submitted for inspection.,21214,430
28797,Skybuilders' Highland Spring Water,"Any water gathered from Il Mheg is likely to have been enchanted by either the pixies or the Fuath, though that is a problem for the skybuilders, not you, to worry about.",22678,430
28798,Skybuilders' Resin,"Thankfully, the resin appears to have suffered no ill effects during your return from the Rak'tika Greatwood, meaning that it is still a gelatinous blob with seemingly no practical application whatsoever.",22638,430

29729,Rhotano Sardine,"Usually seen traveling in large schools, these rather plain fish possess the group mentality of a flock of sheep─that is, to follow whoever is in front and, lacking that, just keep moving forward until something with big teeth appears. Then all hells break loose.

[Suitable for printing on large canvases.]",29147,1
29746,Sabaton,"Strangely for a mollusk, its body is covered in hard scales in addition to the more common shell. Many predators will steer clear of them simply because they are a bother to eat.

[Suitable for printing on medium canvases.]",29077,1

[Suitable for printing on small canvases.]",29157,1
29748,Hammerclaw,"While most wavekin object quite strongly to being caught on a hook, these crustaceans make life especially difficult for anglers in retaliation. If they are not pinching fingers, they are flailing wildly with their heavy claws, both of which most fishers should and do go to great lengths to avoid.

[Suitable for printing on medium canvases.]",29082,1
29749,Heavenskey,"Due to being highly poisonous, it is believed to send those who eat of its flesh to the heavens. Compared to the seven hells, this may prove a more desirable destination.

[Suitable for printing on small canvases.]",29434,1
29758,Great Grandmarlin,"More often than not, this hulking yet deceptively quick wavekin escapes the angler's hook, usually by severing the line with its blade-like bill.

[Suitable for printing on large canvases.]",29095,1
29759,Shipwreck's Sail,"This wavekin is so broad and flat that it has been compared to the sail of a ship left to float on the tide. In actuality, it is waiting for seabirds to pick the parasites from its flanks.

[Suitable for printing on small canvases.]",29155,1
29765,Roguesaurus,"Named after the river rather than the traditional Lominsan profession. Those unfortunate enough to encounter one will testify that to describe it as roguish would be an understatement, and that “murderous,” “man-eating,” and “malevolent” would all be more applicable adjectives.

[Suitable for printing on extra large canvases.]",28002,1
29766,Merman's Mane,"Though the existence of mermen is much debated, if any were to exist, they would no doubt object to the comparisons drawn between their long locks and the tentacles of this grotesque cephalopod.

[Suitable for printing on medium canvases.]",29072,1
29767,Sweeper,"Its habit of moving its head from side to side while searching the seabed for food has earned it this unusual moniker.

[Suitable for printing on large canvases.]",29085,1
29768,Silencer,"While technically edible, it is not without side effects. Temporary loss of speech being the most noticeable, though there may be others that are harder to detect.

[Suitable for printing on small canvases.]",29156,1
29769,Deep-sea Eel,"As may be inferred from the less-than-spectacular name, this eel resides in the sea. The deep part.

[Suitable for printing on large canvases.]",29088,1
29770,Executioner,"Goes out of its way to make life as difficult as possible for those who enter its territory, including sawing holes in hulls and tearing through nets.

[Suitable for printing on extra large canvases.]",29092,1
29771,Wild Urchin,"A creamy center encased in horrendously sharp spines. Only those who acquire the knack of eating one without impaling themselves can acquire the decidedly acquired taste.

[Suitable for printing on small canvases.]",29813,1
29772,True Barramundi,"This slow-moving, ponderous wavekin manages to avoid the attention of predators by being so unremarkable as to hardly warrant attention in the first place.

[Suitable for printing on medium canvases.]",29546,1
29773,Mopbeard,"Lifting it above the waterline causes it to transform from an elegant oceanic beauty to something resembling...well, a mop.

[Suitable for printing on medium canvases.]",29374,1
29774,Slipsnail,"While it may seem harmless enough, it has a nasty surprise in store for unwitting predators.

[Suitable for printing on small canvases.]",28003,1
29775,Aronnax,"Its remarkable speed is matched only by its unfathomable clumsiness, the combination of which often leads it straight into the waiting nets of fishers.

[Suitable for printing on medium canvases.]",29816,1
29776,Coccosteus,"Revered by the Sahagin and reviled by practically everyone else. Its proclivity for biting fingers means that most who catch one end up wishing they hadn't.

[Suitable for printing on large canvases.]",29093,1
29777,Bartholomew the Chopper,"Suspected by some to be the reincarnation of an unhinged murderer, although it is also known to have a more amiable side. Well, about as amiable as one can expect from a wavekin that revels in killing.

[Suitable for printing on small canvases.]",29075,1
29778,Prowler,"While the word “prowl” may suggest the slow, deliberate movement of one tracking its prey, this particular wavekin is simply slow by nature, mainly as a result of sheer indolence.

[Suitable for printing on small canvases.]",29066,1
29779,Charlatan Survivor,"At first glance, the charlatan survivor may appear to be a well-armored crustacean, but the outer shell is merely a purloined disguise concealing a much smaller creature beneath. Luckily, predatory wavekin are quite easily deceived and often choose to leave it alone in order to pursue less chitinous prey.

[Suitable for printing on medium canvases.]",29086,1
29780,Prodigal Son,"Rather than follow the standard migratory patterns of his brethren, this wandering wavekin swims to the beat of his own drum, and comes and goes as he pleases.

[Suitable for printing on medium canvases.]",29331,1
29781,Gugrusaurus,"Spends most of its life attempting to slaughter anything and everything that it catches sight of. Considering the ample opportunities to practice such skills, it has become rather good at it.

[Suitable for printing on extra large canvases.]",29162,1
29782,Funnel Shark,"Its gaping maw draws in all manner of ocean life, along with a range of less-than-edible objects.

[Suitable for display in aquariums tier 4 and higher.]
[Suitable for printing on extra large canvases.]",29731,1
29783,The Fallen One,"Believed by some to have descended from the heavens, and judging by the way it nervously flits about the ocean, it wishes it could return to whence it came. Few wavekin look less comfortable in their habitat than this unfortunate creature.

[Suitable for printing on medium canvases.]",28004,1
29784,Spectral Megalodon,"Due to the fact that most of its prey are petrified upon catching sight of this ominously glowing predator, it has rather an easy time finding a steady supply of food.

[Suitable for display in aquariums tier 4 and higher.]
[Suitable for printing on extra large canvases.]",28005,1
29785,Spectral Discus,"This aetherially infused wavekin gathers rather a lot of unwanted attention, and it has no natural defenses to fend off curious predators.

[Suitable for display in aquariums tier 2 and higher.]
[Suitable for printing on medium canvases.]",28006,1
29786,Spectral Sea Bo,"Its strange blue glow seems to have done wonders for its self-confidence, and it can be seen doing the underwater variation of strutting like a peacock...or whatever the chocobo equivalent of a peacock is.

[Suitable for printing on small canvases.]",28007,1
29787,Spectral Bass,"This most ordinary of fish has become rather extraordinary thanks to being bathed in otherworldly aether, giving it a fetching blue tinge.

[Suitable for display in aquariums tier 3 and higher.]
[Suitable for printing on large canvases.]",28008,1
29788,Sothis,"It is unclear how this species of turtle came to have a shell covered in glittering crystal, though it does give oceanic hunters pause for thought before they attempt to bite down on it. This could be considered a form of unnatural protection.

[Suitable for display in aquariums tier 4 and higher.]
[Suitable for printing on extra large canvases.]",28009,1
29789,Coral Manta,"Few creatures can claim to have an entire ecosystem on their back, although this appears to afford the host no practical benefits whatsoever.

[Suitable for display in aquariums tier 4 and higher.]
[Suitable for printing on extra large canvases.]",28010,1
29790,Stonescale,"The thick covering of rock-like substance does little to improve this shark's mobility. Being an apex predator means it has little need of excessive armor plating.

[Suitable for display in aquariums tier 4 and higher.]
[Suitable for printing on extra large canvases.]",28011,1
29791,Elasmosaurus,"In the harsh, unforgiving open sea, few creatures have proven a more valuable ally to mankind than the elasmosaurus. Though they are most often known to tow ships and carry out courageous acts of self-sacrifice, these gentle giants can also be lethally dangerous when angered.

[Suitable for printing on extra large canvases.]",28012,1
29792,Grade 2 Skybuilders' Plywood,"While this could be combined with a few bricks to create a makeshift bench, that may fall somewhat short of the skybuilders' rather more lofty aspirations.",22507,20

29798,Grade 2 Skybuilders' Ink,"While some may question the skybuilders' need for a specific type of ink, it is believed that this particular variety is more resistant to the cold.

29800,Grade 2 Skybuilders' Crate,"Despite much of the work in the Firmament involving taking supplies <Emphasis>out of</Emphasis> boxes, the need occasionally arises to put them <Emphasis>into</Emphasis> boxes instead.

29814,Grade 2 Skybuilders' Dye,"Those thinking about using this colorful dye for their own purposes should put such thoughts aside, as it is strictly for skybuilder use only.

29815,Grade 2 Skybuilders' Tea,Skybuilders have garnered a reputation for punctuating their work with frequent tea breaks. The number of cups drunk by a laborer over the course of a single day can easily reach double digits.,24408,150
29816,Grade 2 Skybuilders' Stepladder,"Unlike most other items requested by the skybuilders, this one actually seems to serve some practical purpose.

29817,Grade 2 Skybuilders' Crosscut Saw,"The sound it makes as it cleaves through timber is akin to that of a person snoring.

29819,Grade 2 Skybuilders' Stone,A strong contender for the heaviest item requested by the skybuilders. How the volunteers are expected to transport these without an exceedingly sturdy cart is anyone's guess.,21251,290

29821,Grade 2 Skybuilders' Gloves,"Keepers of hounds with the tendency to bite the hand that feeds will be delighted to receive a pair of these fine gloves. The smooth lining allows the wearer to slip out easily, leaving said dog with a mouthful of tough leather, which it will soon learn makes a poor substitute for proper food.",44098,290
29822,Grade 2 Skybuilders' Soap,"When combined with an empty stocking, can be used as a makeshift weapon. In Ishgard, this appears to be the most common use, since many residents have discovered that the need to wash is largely mitigated by the wearing of multiple layers of thick clothing, which does little to prevent bodily odor, but does cause it to take longer to seep through and reach the nostrils of those in the immediate vicinity.",26591,290

29829,Grade 2 Skybuilders' Gazebo,"Purpose-built for picnics in the great outdoors, protecting those beneath from any untimely precipitation. Unfortunately, the snow in most parts of Coerthas tends to fall in a rather sideways fashion, thus rendering this gazebo entirely pointless.",50306,430
29830,Grade 2 Skybuilders' Alchemic,The joy gained from sampling its fragrance─reminiscent of summer meadows─normally only lasts until the caustic vapors burn the skin from the inside of one's nostrils.,22606,430
29831,Grade 2 Skybuilders' Stew,"The term “potluck” applies perfectly to this particular dish, as it is traditionally assembled from whatever the chef can dig up from an often poorly lit pantry. The fact that rats tend to squeak and wriggle a fair bit when picked up is probably all that prevents them from being added to the mix. The dead ones, on the other hand...",53256,430
29832,Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilders' Wardrobe,"If, for any reason, one has the need to hide inside, such as the unexpected return of one of the residents and so on, the air holes provided should prevent untimely suffocation. Not that there is such a thing as “timely suffocation.”",52675,481

29837,Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilders' Wallpaper,"Generally less messy than covering walls with paint, although its natural tendency to tear and wrinkle with the slightest provocation is enough to make a saint swear.",51248,481
29838,Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilders' Remedies,"It is assumed that each of these glass phials contains something useful, as none of them are labeled. Identification by taste is probably best left to a professional or someone who is not opposed to being lightly poisoned.",53100,481
29839,Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilders' Quiche,"In cases such as these, “artisanal” actually means “so complex that even the chef doesn't remember what went into it,” hence the impossibility of replicating the recipe.",24208,481
29840,Approved Grade 2 Skybuilders' Switch,"A sharp rap across the back of the thigh in the cold, crisp Ishgardian morning air with one of these light and flexible branches is a surefire way to blow away the proverbial cobwebs of any workers caught yawning.

29906,Grade 2 Skybuilders' Beehive,"A bee colony will often respond to the presence of intruders by swarming their intended target and using their own body heat to cook it alive. The skybuilders have discovered that this can be utilized to keep their hands warm, although the fact that said bees are still very much capable of stinging does present a minor flaw in this otherwise brilliant idea.

29907,Grade 2 Skybuilders' Straw,"In some parts of Eorzea, straw is used to weave hats with wide peaks to keep the sun from the wearer's eyes. Fortunately─or perhaps unfortunately─for Ishgardians, there is seldom enough sunlight to warrant such headwear, and the vicious winds would prevent the owner from remaining behatted for more than a few scant moments.

29908,Grade 2 Skybuilders' Tea Leaves,"For Ishgardians, discussing the virtues of various blends of tea is almost as much of a pastime as actually drinking the stuff.

29911,Grade 2 Skybuilders' Asphaltum,"Plans to use this sticky, black substance to cover the streets of Ishgard were vehemently opposed, as it would ruin the uniformly grey aesthetic─which on most days includes the sky itself.

29914,Grade 2 Skybuilders' Oak Log,"The tiny acorn that grew into this mighty oak had its life cut tragically short by the cruel axe of a woodsman (or possibly woodslady). If there is any justice in the world, it will be born anew as a nice dresser or an attractive hat stand.

29915,Grade 2 Skybuilders' Feather,"While even Ishgard's finest ornithologist would be hard-pressed to identify the bird from which this came, one thing is certain: there are more where this came from, unless said bird only ever possessed a single feather.

29916,Grade 2 Skybuilders' Vine,"Careless owners of high-walled castles in faerie tales often allow these to grow over said walls, thereby allowing dashing heroes to infiltrate the premises to steal jewels, damsels in distress, scones from the pantry, and so forth.

29930,Grade 2 Skybuilders' Crystal-clear Rock Salt,"With a name that long, one might be forgiven for expecting it to be some sort of miraculous super-salt, capable of turning even the blandest dish into a festival of flavor.

29934,Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilders' Log,"As the skybuilders prefer to use wooden planks of standardized dimensions, this log is already cut to be exactly the length they require, to minimize the carpenters' workload.

29935,Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilders' Hardened Sap,"Although the practical applications of a piece of hardened sap are somewhat unclear, it is at least considerably less sticky than unhardened sap, which helps to keep it free of impurities such as loose hairs, bits of pocket fluff, and so on.

29938,Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilders' Dawn Lizard,"Those wondering what separates this from a non-artisanal dawn lizard need only observe the way it devours its prey.

30018,Approved Grade 2 Skybuilders' Pirarucu,"The pirarucu's habit of swallowing the lure whole means that most anglers wait until the beast is well and truly dead before they attempt to retrieve it. There is always the option of leaving it in the fish's belly─but that would be a nasty surprise for the poor soul who has to gut it.

※Not included in the fish guide.",23851,150
30019,Approved Grade 2 Skybuilders' Brown Bolo,"While this bizarre creature is known to entangle its prey in a manner similar to its namesake, the grade 2 variety can be used as an actual bolo when thrown. Just make sure the thing is dead first or you may find yourself being the one entangled.

※Not included in the fish guide.",23852,150
30020,Approved Grade 2 Skybuilders' Bitterling,"Most creatures tend not to enjoy being pulled to their death via a hook to the mouth, but this poor specimen looks especially miserable when caught.

※Not included in the fish guide.",23859,290
30021,Approved Grade 2 Skybuilders' Caiman,"Though the skybuilders are often willing to take in scalekin captured alive, they have specifically requested that any caiman presented be certifiably dead before being brought to the Firmament. Given its resemblance to a wingless dragon, the less sensible members of the populace may fear a second Dragonsong War is upon them.

※Not included in the fish guide.",23856,290
30022,Approved Grade 2 Skybuilders' Cloud Cutter,"Often caught accidentally by anglers in mid-cast, due to its habit of flying several fulms above the waterline.

※Not included in the fish guide.",23861,430
30023,Approved Grade 2 Skybuilders' Vampiric Tapestry,"Another species that largely fails to live up to its namesake, especially the “vampiric” part. As for “tapestry,” the only similarity appears to be the shared ability to stay stuck to a wall through the use of a series of well-placed pins.

※Not included in the fish guide.",23864,430
30024,Approved Grade 2 Skybuilders' Tupuxuara,"The word “fishing” usually implies that some sort of aquatic, or at the very least, amphibious creature is the intended prey, though the paraphernalia used by anglers is equally effective for snagging flying scalekin. Whether one would actually want to or not is a separate matter entirely.

※Not included in the fish guide.",23866,430
30025,Approved Grade 2 Skybuilders' Blind Manta,"As this species of manta uses echolocation to find its way around, it can be heard making a series of high-pitched squeals when hoisted out of the water. Many fishers end up feeling sorrow for the poor beast and returning it whence it came, although the more cynically minded suspect it of intentionally wielding a pity-based form of self-defense.

※Not included in the fish guide.",23850,430
30026,Approved Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilders' Rhomaleosaurus,"An aquatic scalekin so enormous that one cannot help but wonder how a mere fishing rod could bear its weight.

※Not included in the fish guide.",23849,440
30027,Approved Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilders' Gobbie Mask,"According to some sources, several attempts have been made by goblins to convert the carcasses of these cephalopods into masks. Unfortunately, the retch-inducing stench is too much for most to bear, especially when in such close proximity to the face.

※Not included in the fish guide.",23865,440
30028,Approved Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilders' Pterodactyl,"One must take great care when attempting to catch one of these winged scalekin, as they may find themselves lifted from the ground. In such cases, it is normally best to let go of the rod, although the more absent-minded may find themselves clinging on for dear life for reasons that even they cannot comprehend.

※Not included in the fish guide.",23867,440
30029,Approved Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilders' Skyfish,"Sought by collectors as a rare curio rather than for its use in Ishgardian cuisine. Often used to decorate trees during the Starlight Celebration, although the smell does get to be quite noticeable after a few days.

※Not included in the fish guide.",23860,440
30030,Approved Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilders' Cometfish,"Named not for the speed with which it cuts through the water, but for the fact that, much like its namesake, having one fall on your head can be rather painful.

※Not included in the fish guide.",23868,440
30031,Approved Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilders' Anomalocaris,"This airborne cephalopod often dives from above to savage unsuspecting anglers, as it is presumably a follower of the “get your retaliation in first” style of self-defense. However, a well-timed sidestep and a well-placed fishing net can soon turn the tables.

※Not included in the fish guide.",23862,440
30032,Approved Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilders' Rhamphorhynchus,"It is strongly advised not to attempt to spear this particular species, as more often than not, it ends up doing most of the spearing.

※Not included in the fish guide.",23863,440
30033,Approved Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilders' Dragon's Soul,"While most people are aware by now that this is not the soul of a dragon trapped in the rather pathetic and quite small body of a wavekin, it is nevertheless allowed to keep its incredibly impressive name.

※Not included in the fish guide.",23848,440

31597,Grade 3 Artisanal Skybuilders' Blind Manta,"One might wonder how these eyeless creatures are able to navigate the clouds of the Diadem.

31736,Oddly Delicate Saw Part,The words “delicate” and “saw” are seldom seen in such close proximity.,26115,1
31737,Oddly Delicate Cross-pein Hammer Part,"Presumably once this delicate part is attached to the rest of the tool, it will somehow gain the ability to withstand all the hammering that is sure to follow.",26115,1
31738,Oddly Delicate Raising Hammer Part,Thankfully the pot used to house the part and the protective jelly in which it is suspended are considerably less delicate. Obviously shaking or dropping it would be extremely ill-advised.,26115,1
31739,Oddly Delicate Lapidary Hammer Part,"A small round pot may not seem the obvious choice for the transportation of parts of any kind, regardless of their delicate nature, but perhaps the Skysteel engineers had a surplus of them lying about the manufactory.",26115,1
31740,Oddly Delicate Round Knife Part,"Some of the Skysteel engineers fear that due to its delicate nature, this particular part may struggle to fit in with the rather more robust components that comprise the round knife.",26115,1
31741,Oddly Delicate Needle Part,"Needles, by and large, tend not to include multiple parts, but the Skysteel engineers have ever sought to defy common sense.",26115,1
31742,Oddly Delicate Alembic Part,"Even a standard alembic is rather fragile to begin with, so adding an oddly delicate part will only exacerbate the problem.",26115,1
31743,Oddly Delicate Frypan Part,One can only hope that the liberal application of heat does not offend this part's delicate sensibilities.,26115,1
31744,Oddly Delicate Hatchet Part,"Once the hatchet is completed, one must remember to go about their hacking and slashing with great care so as not to spoil the oddly delicate part attached to it.",26115,1
31745,Inconceivably Delicate Hatchet Part,It would probably be sensible to protect this inconceivably delicate part with rather less delicate parts.,26116,1
31746,Oddly Delicate Pickaxe Part,Time will tell whether the addition of this oddly delicate part will actually improve one's ability to smash rocks into smaller rocks.,26115,1
31747,Inconceivably Delicate Pickaxe Part,Poor workmen who blame their tools will have no excuses once this piece is attached.,26116,1
31748,Oddly Delicate Fishing Rod Part,"Your fellow anglers will no doubt be impressed by the length to which you have gone to improve your fishing rod. After all, showing off in front of others is what fishing is all about.",26115,1
31749,Oddly Delicate Fishing Reel Part,"Only the most dedicated of fishers would even consider the use of such an oddly delicate component, but the obsessive pursuit of the very best equipment available is as much a part of the hobby as actually catching the fish.",26116,1

31751,Oddly Delicate Silver Gear,Perhaps it would be prudent to match this gear with others of a similarly delicate disposition.,26270,500
31752,Oddly Delicate Wolfram Square,This delicate square must be treated with the utmost care before holding it over a blazing forge and smashing it repeatedly with a hammer.,20961,500
31753,Oddly Delicate Celestine,The rays of light refracted by this crystal are so delicate that they can be broken simply by waving one's hand through them.,21286,500
31754,Oddly Delicate Gazelle Leather,This leather somehow managed to retain its delicacy despite being subjected to the far-from-gentle tanning process.,22014,500
31755,Oddly Delicate Rhea Cloth,"Great care must be taken not to stretch, crumple, crease, or─if possible─touch this specimen, lest its intrinsic delicateness be marred.",21622,500
31756,Oddly Delicate Holy Water,"Most water is delicate by its very nature, this sort even more so.",22653,500
31757,Oddly Delicate Shark Oil,The treatment to which the shark was subjected to extract its oil was anything but delicate.,22636,500
31758,Oddly Delicate Pine Log,"Yes, this is a delicate log. Oddly so, in fact.",22414,500
31759,Oddly Delicate Silvergrace Ore,"For all its delicacy, this is nevertheless a chunk of ore, and quite capable of leaving a nasty mark when thrown at someone's head.",21213,500
31760,Oddly Delicate Scheelite,"While standard scheelite is certainly rare, the oddly delicate variant is scarce to the point of being practically nonexistent.",21208,500
31761,Oddly Delicate Raw Celestine,"This chunk of unrefined crystal is not itself especially delicate, but has the potential to produce pieces of remarkable delicacy. Whether this is beneficial in any way whatsoever, however, remains to be seen.",21472,500
31762,Oddly Delicate Gazelle Hide,Rest assured that the gazelle to which this once belonged was slaughtered in the most delicate way possible.,21812,500
31763,Oddly Delicate Rhea,"Rhea this oddly delicate is reserved for the production of oddly delicate rhea cloth. It is then, in turn, used to make all sorts of cloth-based items, provided that they are not hindered in any way by being oddly delicate, which rules out practically everything.",21651,500
31764,Oddly Delicate Mistletoe,"If one happens to eat one of these poisonous berries, they may find that their stomach also becomes oddly delicate.",25001,500
31765,Oddly Delicate Hammerhead Shark,"The “oddly delicate” part refers not to the shark's physical attributes, but to its demeanor. Due to being dead, however, this is something of a moot point.",29026,500
31766,Oddly Delicate Feather,"For all the feathers adorning a cloudkin's body, only a rare few could be considered oddly delicate. Those are generally found around the wingpit, the avian equivalent of an armpit, obviously.",21903,500
31767,Oddly Delicate Birch Log,"Oddly delicate for a birch log, though still fairly hefty by most people's standards.",22421,500
31768,Oddly Delicate Adamantite Ore,"Adamantite, as the name would suggest, is anything but delicate, though this particular sample is perhaps ever-so-slightly less than “practically indestructible.”",21224,500
31769,Oddly Delicate Raw Jade,Hopefully not so delicate that it will shatter into a thousand pieces at the first attempt to refine it.,21252,500
31770,Flintstrike,"The glow it emits when swimming through the ocean depths is reminiscent of sparks flying from a struck flint. Thankfully, it does not present an actual fire hazard, despite what some may think.

Can only be caught when equipped with a skysung fishing rod.

31771,Pickled Pom,"Closely resembling a moogle's pom-pom, apart from the strange odor. Saying it smells pickled is a rather charitable description.

31918,Grade 4 Skybuilders' Rope,"While this may seem like a good choice for a children's skipping rope, it is weighty enough to leave a painful welt on either the temples or ankles of those with a poor sense of timing. Still, some might say that only adds to the fun.",26103,20
31919,Grade 4 Skybuilders' Ink,"The grade 4 variety of ink is said to be especially quick-drying, which helps to prevent smudging. Some claim, however, that the ink dries before it even has time to reach the parchment, which does rather defeat the purpose of the ink in the first place.",25921,20

31922,Grade 4 Skybuilders' Nails,"In traditional Doman carpentry, the wooden pieces are carefully carved to allow them to snugly interlock and remain steadfast for years to come. In Ishgard, however, the wood is considerably less cooperative, and must have little metal spikes driven through it to stay where it is told. ",21009,40
31923,Grade 4 Skybuilders' Rivets,"Although being covered in rivets tends to make basically anything look a lot more sturdy, the act of driving them in to begin with probably compromises the object's structural integrity to some degree. It certainly has that effect on a person's skull.",21014,40

31937,Grade 4 Skybuilders' Stepladder,"“Takes just as many steps to climb up as it does to climb down” is the slogan used by the skybuilders when pitching their stepladders to potential customers, though any sales made tend to be in spite of said slogan rather than because of it.",51676,290

31939,Grade 4 Skybuilders' Mesail,"As any smith will attest, the heat of the forge can be overwhelming. Were it not for the conveniently placed air holes, their heads would be baked inside their mesails like cow-brain pies (an Ishgardian delicacy).",40412,290
31940,Grade 4 Skybuilders' Stone,"Since ancient times, man has sought to move exceedingly large blocks of stone from one location to another. In the past, methods such as conveying the material atop a series of rolling logs or ferrying it on extremely buoyant rafts were employed, whereas all it requires these days is one plucky volunteer with bottomless pockets.",21251,290
31941,Grade 4 Skybuilders' Longboots,"It is said that over the years, the design for longboots grew longer and longer, until the two boots eventually met in the middle and lost the part covering the foot entirely─perhaps to save on materials─and became what are now known as trousers.",46539,290

31944,Grade 4 Skybuilders' All-purpose Infusion,"A remarkable concoction that is able to treat any ailment the salesperson is able to imagine. The lack of complaints following purchase indicates that the customer is either entirely satisfied with the effects, or dead from poisoning.",24413,290

31946,Grade 4 Skybuilders' Oven,"Sometimes, the phrase “she's got a bun in the oven” is meant to be taken literally. In fact, this common saying has led to all sorts of hilarious misunderstandings, particularly in cases where the woman in question likes to bake her own bread.",26593,430
31947,Grade 4 Skybuilders' Lamppost,"Spare a thought for the poor souls whose job it is to light each of the lanterns that line the streets of the Firmament every evening.

31949,Grade 4 Skybuilders' Overalls,"While it is common for mud, paint, and other stains to collect on overalls, some of the skybuilders have taken to deliberately dirtying their clothing to fool others into thinking they have been hard at work.

31951,Grade 4 Skybuilders' Growth Formula,"There are rumors that claim the remarkable height of Elezen is due to doses of growth formula being slipped into their morning porridge from a young age. Attempts to reproduce such an effect on the Lalafells who willingly volunteered as test subjects have yet to yield results, other than an unnatural aversion to porridge.",22663,430
31952,Grade 4 Skybuilders' Stew,"Many culinarians believe the secret to a good stew is to never allow the pot to become empty by constantly topping it up with fresh ingredients. This may in fact be an elaborate ploy to avoid ever having to wash the pot, not to mention that some parts of the stew may have been in the mix for several years without being served. Diners are advised to “eat around” anything that seems a bit suspicious.",53256,430
31953,Grade 4 Artisanal Skybuilders' Icebox,"Though such a device would seem to have little use in Ishgard, where foodstuffs may be kept chilled simply by placing them outside, the icebox does offer protection from rats and crows. But then again, so would any other type of box.",26120,511

31955,Grade 4 Artisanal Skybuilders' Company Chest,"This communal deposit relies on the honesty of not only every member of the company─to give what they can and take only what they need─but every other person who passes through the Firmament, as it is left completely unlocked at all times.

31957,Grade 4 Artisanal Skybuilders' Tool Belt,"While it may not seem especially voluminous, this belt is capable of holding up to thirty-five primary tools and the same number of secondary tools.

31959,Grade 4 Artisanal Skybuilders' Tincture,"“Should you find any mysterious phials of liquid, be sure to take them with you.

32032,Grade 4 Skybuilders' Truespring Water,"The advertising slogan, “Spring water never tasted so true,” has left many Ishgardians both impressed and baffled in equal measure.
